#We always start programming with a Hello World

'''Hello World programs are ubiquitous as a first project for a few reasons:
    *Printing text to a screen is usually the simplest action in a language
    *It is very easy to determine success or failure (it prints or it doesnt)
    *

#The if statement below is a weird python thing. We can ignore it for now
'''If you need to know what this is, it would be easiest to describe as an
    invocation statement. Python is a scripting language, so functions like 
    \main\ arent run by default. This statement tells python to run the
    defined function above in the given sequence.
